   hoare_asgn_wrong

   {{ True }} X ::= a {{ X = a }}

   Proof: by contradiction.
   Assume a is X + 1 for any value of X.
    - Our precondition is True and hence satisfied.
    - Our postcondition is X = X + 1. When the assignment is made,
      X ::= a brings state st to a st' where X' equals X + 1. The
      postcondition applies to this state st', and thus can be transformed
      to X' + 1. X' + 1 <> X + 1, and so this type of forward rule will
      not work correctly in all instances.
