Formalize semantics of Verilog in Coq. Embed the Verilog syntax within
Coq a la "The world's best macros assembler." See bitsrep.v in
https://github.com/maximedenes/coq-amd64/tree/master/src for defining
bits, words, etc. (and entire repo in general for proofs)
Follow along with Verilog by Example book.

First step: establish inductive definition of basic
  Verilog module and "assign" expressions, then
  inductive relation for execution (which proceeds by clock cycle)
