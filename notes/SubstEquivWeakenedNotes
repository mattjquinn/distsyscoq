We must show that for any aexp a1, (AId Y) == a1 when X == Y and X is not present in a1.

If X is not used in a1, and X == Y, we know Y is not used in a1.
  - And if Y is not used in a1, a1 can't be equivalent to (AId Y)
  

Y



if a2 is (AId Y) and X is not used anywhere in a1, then substituting X with a1 in (AId Y) yields (AId Y)



X = A + 1  (we know X is not used anywhere in a1)
_ = Y
    - if X == Y, we can replace with A + 1    (now show that Y == A + 1
                                                        show X == A + 1 (b/c X == Y)
                                                        trivial by previous statement
    - if X <> Y, we leave it as (AId Y)       (proof is trivial by equality)


PROOF STEPS
- rewrite aequiv (AId Y) a1 to aequiv (AId X) a1 (by equality of X and Y)
- rewrite aequiv (AId X) a1 to aequiv a1 a1 or aequiv (AId X) (AId X) (by assignment of previous statement)


AUXILARY LEMMA
if i ::= a / st \\ st'
then aeval st' (AId i) = aeval st a





If X ::= a1 / st \\ st'
and X is not used in a1,
then the value of X (in st') is the same as that of evaluating a1 (in st')
