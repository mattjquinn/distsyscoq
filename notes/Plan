1) Define simple arithmetic circuit in Coq.

2) Prove something about it.

3) Extract to VHDL/Verilog.

4) Synthesize/run on FPGA simulator/board.


Long-term: formally verify a cryptographic algo/protocol.
Opportunity areas: formal verification, cryptography, FPGAs (aerospace, medical, financial, etc.)
FPGAs being used increasingly in aerospace and defense applications.
