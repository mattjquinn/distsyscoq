 *   Informally:
 *   Theorem: for any natural numbers n and m,
 *     n + m = m + n.
 *   Proof" By induction on n.
 *     First, suppose n = 0.
 *       Then, 0 + m = m + 0. Any m + 0 is m, so this case is true
 *         by reflexivity.
 *     Second, suppose n = 1 + n.
 *       Then (1 + n) + m = m + (1 + n).
 *       By definition of plus, we can rewrite this as 1 + (n + m) = m + (1 + n).
 *       By our induction hypothesis, we can rearrange to 1 + (m + n) = m + (1 + n).
 *       By definition of plus, the RHS can be written as 1 + (m + n). Qed.

 *    Reproduced here:
 * 
 * Theorem beq_nat_refl : forall n : nat,
 *   true = beq_nat n n.
 * Proof.
 *   intros n. induction n as [| n' IHn' ].
 *   - reflexivity.
 *   - simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity. Qed.
 * 
 *    Informally:
 *    Theorem: for any natural number n, true = beq_nat n n.
 *    Proof: by induction on n.
 *      Base case: n = 0
 *        Given two arguments of 0, beq_nat 0 0 simplifies immediately to true.
 *      Inductive case: n = 1 + n.
 *        Given two arguments of 1 + n, beq_nat (1+n) (1+n) simplifies to
 *        beq_nat n' m'. This is true immediately from our inductive hypothesis. Qed. *)
