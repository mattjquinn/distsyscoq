"We are seeking postdoctoral researchers to work in a small, agile team at NASA Ames Research Park in Silicon Valley on the multi-year QUASAR project (Quantifiable Assurance Cases for Trusted Autonomy), part of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Assured Autonomy research program. The successful candidates will undertake fundamental research into the foundations of ‘Dynamic Assurance Cases’ (DACs), which aim to provide quantified assurance of trustworthiness in the design and operation of learning-enabled autonomous systems."
  - Position located at Moffet Field

Primary <-> Backup

P increments counter
P sends counter to B via single bidirectional FIFO channel
B receives counter via channel
B increments counter

Safety Property:
- Backup counter never exceeds Primary's

PROOF STEPS
-> Definitions
-> Define step-relation
-> Examples of traces with step-relation
   applied to show end result
-> Proof that safety property holds for
   any nodes P and B


ONCE BASICS WORK:

Step-relation on channel
-> no change
-> drops packet
-> reorders packets (removes FIFO constraint)

WHICH REQUIRES
-> sequence number on packets to prevent outdated packets from being read
