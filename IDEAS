Primary <-> Backup

P increments counter
P sends counter to B via single bidirectional FIFO channel
B receives counter via channel
B increments counter

Safety Property:
- Backup counter never exceeds Primary's

PROOF STEPS
-> Definitions
-> Define step-relation
-> Examples of traces with step-relation
   applied to show end result
-> Proof that safety property holds for
   any nodes P and B


ONCE BASICS WORK:

Step-relation on channel
-> no change
-> drops packet
-> reorders packets (removes FIFO constraint)

WHICH REQUIRES
-> sequence number on packets to prevent outdated packets from being read
